This 14-day JavaScript vs. TypeScript challenge was designed to build a strong foundation in both languages by solving one consistent problem across multiple concepts. Each day demonstrated how JS and TS approach the same task, highlighting their strengths, trade-offs, and practical use cases. By the end of the challenge, the differences between JavaScript’s speed and flexibility and TypeScript’s safety, maintainability, and scalability become much clearer. Continued experimentation, refactoring, and exploration of advanced topics will further strengthen real-world development skills.
